# Real_Estate
The aim is to develop and deploy a system that effectively oversees the properties of a real estate agency, leveraging the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the programming language C++.. All properties contain information related to the address of the properties, the candle, and whether it is available for rent or sale. In addition, the system has features of registration, consultation, update, and removal of real estate.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm or methodology that organizes code and data into reusable objects. The fundamental concept of OOP revolves around creating objects, which are instances of classes, and using them to model and manipulate complex systems. In OOP, objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit. The attributes represent the state or properties of an object, while the methods define the operations or actions that an object can perform. Objects can interact with each other by sending messages and invoking methods.

## Informations

To navigate within the platform, please utilize the directional arrows on the keyboard, along with the ESC button and the ENTER key.

Available property types for manipulation are as follows:

+ **House:** This type encompasses information related to a residential house, including the number of floors, the number of bedrooms, the land area, and the built-up area.
+ **Apartment:** This category comprises details about an apartment unit, such as its area, the number of bedrooms, the orientation (e.g., south-facing, north-facing), the floor level, the condominium fee, and the number of parking spaces available.
+ **Land:** This type pertains to information concerning a plot of land, specifically its area.

The system comprises five distinct functions, namely:

+ Register **only one property** at a time (houses, apartments, or land).

+ **List**
  + All available properties (shows only property title, Neighborhood, City, and Value).
  + All properties based on their type (house, apartment, land), displaying all the characteristics.
  + All properties choosing the category (rent or sale), displaying all the atributes of the property.
 
+ **Search and display** the properties (exhibiting all the characteristics of the property)
  + By Neighborhood.
  + By City.
  + By Title.
  + By value greater or less than another.
  
+ **Remove** a property
  + Search for the property before removing.
  + If more than one property is found, display its index for the user type and do the removal.

+ **Edit** a property record
  + Search for the property to update.
  + Select the attribute that you wish to modify.

+ **Save** the data in a file
  + The system should incorporate a functionality to store the data currently held in memory to a file
  + The save method must be invoked upon program termination.
